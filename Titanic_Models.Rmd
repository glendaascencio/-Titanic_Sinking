##### In this research, I used regular expressions and data mining skills to analyze the sinking of the Titanic. The titanic dataset contains 1313 observations and 7 variables, each observation represents a passenger. In addition, a decision tree model will be developed with the purpose to predict whether a person would have survived the accident based on the variables Age, Sex and Pclass (travel class). 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Set Working Directory
setwd(".")

###### =>
## Import titanic from csv
titanic <- read.csv("Titanic.csv")

## Looking at the titanic dataset
dim(titanic)
names(titanic)

## Obtaning some statistical results
summary(na.omit(titanic))

## Generating a histogram of Age column
hist(titanic$Age)

## Printing out proportion of passengers that survived
mean(titanic$Survived)

###### Using regular expressions to to classify married and single men and women      #####
## Extracting the name column from titanic
pass_names <- titanic$Name
View(pass_names)

## Creating a logical vectror is_man that looks for the pattern Mr
is_man <- grepl(", Mr\\.", pass_names)


## Counting number of men based on gender. The sum of is_man doesn't match with the Sex column in titanic, so we've must have missed some titles that also refer to men! 
sum(titanic$Sex == "male")

#Therefore, we'll be passing a clever gsub() command that extracts the title part for the titanic dataset. The pattern we'll need is the following: "^.*, (.*?)\\..*$"

titles <- gsub("^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", pass_names)

# unique() on titles get an overview of all different titles that are found in the name vector. 
unique(titles)

## Then, we store all the titles for men in the title vector
titles <- paste(",", c("Mr\\.", "Master", "Don", "Rev", "Dr\\.", "Major", "Sir", "Col", "Capt", "Jonkheer"))


### => If you want want to change men's names to a modern format, without a title, and change the women's names to only include their own name you can do the following command
convert_name <- function(name) {
  # women: take name from inside parentheses
  if (grepl("\\(.*?\\)", name)) {
    gsub("^.*?\\((.*?)\\)$", "\\1", name)
  # men: take name before comma and after title
  } else {
    # Finish the gsub() function
    gsub("^(.*?),\\s[a-zA-Z\\.]*?\\s(.*?)$", "\\2 \\1", name)
  }
}

## Call convert_name on name
clean_pass_names <- vapply(pass_names, FUN = convert_name,
                           FUN.VALUE = character(1), USE.NAMES = FALSE)

## Print out clean_pass_names
clean_pass_names

#####  Developing a decision tree model with the purpose to predict whether a person would have survived the accident based on the variables Age, Sex and Pclass (travel class) #####

# Set random seed. Don't remove this line
set.seed(1)

# Have a look at the structure of titanic
str(titanic)

# A decision tree classification model is built on the data
tree <- rpart(Survived ~ ., data = titanic, method = "class")

# Use the predict() method to make predictions, assign to pred
pred <- predict(tree, titanic, type="class")

# Use the table() method to make the confusion matrix
table(titanic$Survived, pred)

# So to summarize, 212 out of all 265 survivors were correctly predicted to have survived. On the other hand, 371 out of the 449 deceased were correctly predicted to have perished. 

#                           The survivors correctly predicted to have survived: true positives (TP). The deceased who were wrongly predicted to have survived: false positives (FP). The survivors who were wrongly predicted to have perished: false negatives (FN). The deceased who were correctly predicted to have perished: true negatives (TN)

###################### ex 13
# The confusion matrix is available in your workspace as conf

# Assign TP, FN, FP and TN using conf
TP <- conf[1, 1] # this will be 212
FN <- conf[1, 2] # this will be 78
FP <- conf[2, 1] # fill in 53
TN <- conf[2, 2] # fill in 371

# Calculate and print the accuracy: acc
acc <- (TP+TN)/(TP+FN+FP+TN)
print(acc)

# Calculate and print out the precision: prec
prec <- TP/(TP+FP)
print(prec)

# Calculate and print out the recall: rec
rec <- TP/(TP+FN)
print(rec)

# With an accuracy of around 82%, the model only incorrectly predicted 18% of the passengers' fates.
